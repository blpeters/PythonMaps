# Python Maps 

A collection of maps I've created 100% in Python using the book titled *Python Maps* by Adam Symington, PhD.

Major Python libraries used:
- Pandas and GeoPandas for spatial data manipulation
- Cartopy to work wiht map projections
- Shapely to work with individual geometry objects
- matplotlib (PyPlot) for the visuals
